# Security Policy

If you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us. We update this library regularly to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date. Please use the `latest` version of the library to ensure that you are using the most secure version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to me@jaredwray.com. Once the issue has been validated, we will open a [Github Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories), if necessary.

Once the security advisory has been opened, contributors can collaborate on a private fork to fix the vulnerability. When the issue has been resolved, we will alert users of the past vulnerability by publishing the security advisory.
